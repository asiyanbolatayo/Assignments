            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>
                As mentioned earlier, my name is Muhammed Asiyanbola and I am from Nigeria. I hold a first class honour degree certificate in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Kwara State University.
            </p>
            <p>
                I live in Lagos State and currently work as a Technical Customer Support Representative with a reputable technology company. I have over three years of combined experience in customer support roles across two different companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                From my past experiences, I have developed a strong passion for assisting both internal and external clients in resolving their issues and providing effective, long-term solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy spending time on Twitter and engaging in friendly football matches with my friends.

                <h3>Why I Joined the Cloud Program</h3>
            </h3>
            <p>
                My tech journey began during my student industrial work experience program, where I interned with the Information Technology department.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the internship, I gained practical knowledge in System Administration and Computer Networking.
                I also took several online courses such as Networking Essentials, Python programming, Cybersecurity Essentials and Linux Essentials.
            </p>
            <p>
                The knowledge I garner during the Internship program was helpful during my undergraduate research project. I designed and simulated a private cloud using the Infrastructure as a Cloud model for my department.
                The network layout was designed and simulated using Packet tracer - a networking application built.
            </p>
            <p>
                My biggest reason for joining Alt school cloud engineering program is to learn more about the cloud and seek a career path in cloud engineering.

                <h3>Academic and Future Goal
            </h3>
            <p>
                A diploma degree in Cloud engineering will give me the perfect opportunity to advance not just my professional career but also my aacademic career. I an also excited about the prospect of learning the basic of software engineering as this is something I have always shy away from since undergraduate days.
            </p>
            <p>
                The knowledge I will gain in this study will be useful for when I apply for a masters degree in computer science. It will also be an avenue for me to change my career line from Customer support to Cloud engineering. I am happy to be here and I look forward to learning a lot!
